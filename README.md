# TPA Manager extension

This project has been a extension and improved from original [TPA Manager](https://github.com/MaToSan24/TPA-Manager).

TPA Manager is a web application that allows users to navigate through their scope, in order to manage courses, Team Practices Agreements (TPAs), and TPA templates. It has been developed using Vue.js 3, Vite, and PrimeVue.

## Governify specific configuration

This application has been developed to be used within the Governify framework. In order to do so, some Governify-specific tool like ***Bluejay*** must be deployed in the same server as the TPA Manager.

The following table shows the tools that must be deployed and the corresponding environment variables that must be set in the TPA Manager.

| Tool | Environment variable  | Default value | Example value |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| TPA Manager | - |  http://localhost:5173 | https://tpa-manager.bluejay.governify.io |
| ASSETS_MANAGER_URL | process.env.ASSETS_MANAGER_URL | http://localhost:5200 | https://assets.bluejay.governify.io/ |
| REGISTRY_URL | process.env.REGISTRY_URL | http://localhost:5400 | https://registry.bluejay.governify.io/ |
| SCOPE_MANAGER_URL | process.env.SCOPE_MANAGER_URL | http://localhost:5700 | https://scopes.bluejay.governify.io |
| COLLECTOR_EVENTS_URL | process.env.COLLECTOR_EVENTS_URL | http://localhost:5500 | https://event-collector.bluejay.governify.io/ |
| DASHBOARD_URL | process.env.DASHBOARD_URL | http://localhost:5600 | https://dashboard.bluejay.governify.io/ |
| REPORTER_URL | process.env.REPORTER_URL | http://localhost:5300 | https://reporter.bluejay.governify.io/ |




To set the environment variables:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and set the variables there. The file should look like this (the values are just examples):

```
ASSETS_MANAGER_URL=https://assets.bluejay.governify.io/
REGISTRY_URL=https://registry.bluejay.governify.io/
SCOPE_MANAGER_URL=https://scopes.bluejay.governify.io
COLLECTOR_EVENTS_URL=https://event-collector.bluejay.governify.io/
DASHBOARD_URL=https://dashboard.bluejay.governify.io/
REPORTER_URL=https://reporter.bluejay.governify.io/
```
